A quick word on GSoC Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open source organization on a 3 month programming project during their break from school.\nYou can learn more from their official website.\nHow I got here I have been working with Dart and Flutter(Dart is the language used in it) from about 2018. So when Dart was announced in GSoC this year I was really excited and thought about applying.\nThere were a lot of interesting projects, but I decided to focus on writing a single proposal (keeping my focus solely on one project). The proposal was on generation of Dart FFI bindings. This involved working with LibClang and Dart.\nProject Link -
