Hi, Welcome to my blog, I'll be writing series of posts during my GSoC period,
describing the work accomplished, challenges faced, lessons learnt, etc you know.. stuff??

I will be working with Dart :partying_face: this summer.

# A quick word on GSoC
Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open source organization on a 3 month programming project during their break from school. 

You can learn more from their official [website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

# How I got here
I have been working with Dart and Flutter(Dart is the language used in it) from about 2018.
So when Dart was announced in GSoC this year I was really excited and thought about applying.

There were a lot of interesting projects, but I decided to focus on writing a single
proposal (keeping my focus solely on one project). The proposal was on generation of Dart FFI bindings. This involved working with LibClang and Dart.
